TASK #1: SOME DOLLAR BILLS PROBLEMS

You are supposed to be paid $X dollars. How many bills of hundred, fifty, twenty, ten, five, or one will you get? (For example, if you are to be paid $47, you will get 2 x $20 bills, 1 x $5 bill, and 2 x $1 bills.)

I want to enter an X value, and the program should produce a meaningful output that gives me how that amount should be paid in bills. (Assume/control that the amount will not have decimals—so, no change coins. Actually, make sure of it…)

TASK #2: SOME BOOKSTORE PROBLEMS

Suppose that the cover price of a book is $X, but the bookstores get a 40% discount. Shipping costs $3 for the first copy and ¢75 for each additional copy. Calculate the total wholescale cost and profit (before operational costs) when the bookstore sells Y copies of a book.

I want to enter the X and Y values and get the cost and the profit as a meaningful output.
